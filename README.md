# Ludum-Dare-51
Source code for my LD 51 entry

The `Birb2D` directory symlink at the root of the repo can be replaced with [Birb2D](https://github.com/Toasterbirb/Birb2D) submodule or simply clone the engine to the repository root. I used a symlink in this case because cloning the submodules from github was taking ages for some reason. Also doing engine fixes and stuff during the game jam is way easier when I don't have to go trough git to use the new versions
